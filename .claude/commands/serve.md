Build the local site directory and start a development server on port 8080.

Run:

```
./gradlew serveSite
```

This runs the whole pipeline (`generateLatex` → `generatePdf`, `generateWeb` → `assembleSite`) and starts a detached `jwebserver` (from the Gradle JDK) serving build/site. The task verifies the server answers before reporting success; on failure it prints the server log (build/site-server.log).

Tell the user the site is available at http://localhost:8080. To stop the server: `./gradlew stopSite`.
